The `extra-test` branch in each submodule shows the changes that were made 
to make the application compatible with SBOM.exe.

The rq3 component can be run using `sbom.exe.sh` script.

The rq4 component can be run using the jar generated for each submodule - 
`pdfbox`, `ttorrent`, and `graphhopper`. Or simply run the Main class.
