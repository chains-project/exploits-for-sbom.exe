## ttorrent:1.5

To build \bomiruntime, we had to make changes in the manifest file of the project. Initially, the project was compiled to Java 6. We changed it to Java 8 because Java 21 does not support compilation to Java 6 bytecode.

The rest of the 10 classes are reported as modified because we had to build \texttt{ttorrent-cli:1.5} ourselves as the executable jar was not available on Maven Central.
Since the target version is now 8, the classes are compiled to Java 8 bytecode and packaged together in an executable jar.
However, these modified classes are part of \bomisupplychain and Maven Central hosts the jars with Java 6 bytecode.

## graphhopper:9.1

Second, we set the project version to \texttt{9.1} in the test suite instead of \texttt{9.0-SNAPSHOT} so that the classes like \texttt{com/graphhopper/util/GitInfo} are fetched from Maven Central.
